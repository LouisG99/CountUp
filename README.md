# CountUp

Mobile iOS app that enables to create different counters that enable the user to keep track of the usage of several items.

The idea for this app came from my contact lenses. After 15 days I need to change them, however it's hard to keep track of that as I don't wear them everyday. The app brings a solution to the problem as it will send notifications to the user at a specified time to keep track of the usage. 

Here is a preview of the app:

Once your counter is complete, its appearance will change. You can also create new counters by clicking the button at the bottom of the view.
